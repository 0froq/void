Select defaults to the native control for backward compatibility. Set `:native="false"` for a custom accessible combobox/listbox. Pass options as `{ value, label, disabled? }` and bind a string with `v-model`. `disabled`, `required`, and `name` work in both modes. Other attributes and event listeners go to the native select or custom trigger; `class` and `style` go to the outer container. This is single-value only; use `v-model`, not `value` or `multiple`.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Select } from '@froq/ui'
import { ref } from 'vue'

const options = [
  { value: 'quiet', label: 'Quiet' },
  { value: 'plain', label: 'Plain' },
]
const tone = ref('plain')
</script>

<template>
  <div class="ui">
    <Select
      v-model="tone"
      label="Tone"
      :options="options"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Presentation

The native control has a shared chevron inset 12 px from the right; 34 px of control padding reserves space for it. The chevron ignores pointer events, so native mouse, keyboard, touch and assistive-technology behavior remains on the select. Set optional `framed` (boolean, default false) for a full outline and token background; the framed control inherits its host font. The default keeps the understated underline. Both presentations read only the existing UI token contract.

The custom trigger is borderless unless `framed` is set. Its list matches Menu: a hairline (`--ui-line`), radius 0, no shadow, and 11px `--ui-font-meta`. A highlighted row is underlined, with no fill and no accent bar. The checked row keeps `--ui-fg` text and a 5px accent dot in the start gutter. Selection is independent of disabled state. Arrow keys, typeahead, Enter/Space, Escape, and outside dismissal are handled by Reka UI. The dropdown stays inside the control's token scope, including when portaled. Reduced-motion preferences disable the trigger's color transition. See [Language](/docs/language).

```vue
<Select
  v-model="tone"
  :native="false"
  :options="options"
  label="Tone"
  hide-label
  accent="oklch(65% 0.16 145)"
/>
```

`accent` is assigned directly to `--ui-accent`: HEX (including alpha), named colors, `rgb()`, `hsl()`, `oklch()`, `color(display-p3 ...)`, and `var(--brand-color)` work when supported by the browser. There is no HEX-only parsing or JavaScript conversion. Omit it to inherit the consumer's accent. Choose an accent with sufficient contrast against `--ui-bg`; this API does not automatically adjust contrast or opacity.

The custom-only `option` slot receives `{ option }` to decorate option text (for example its `lang` attribute). Keep `option.label` as the plain-text name used for keyboard search and the selected value. No trigger slot is needed for the standard presentation.
